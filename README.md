ESP based WiFi controller for itho central ventilation units

*(note: I'm in no way a professional hardware/software engineer and have no background in these subjects. I like this for a hobby, to learn and to share my projects)*

Finished boards can be ordered in my webshop:  
[https://www.nrgwatch.nl](http://www.nrgwatch.nl)  
or in my Tindie store:

## WiFi add-on to control itho central ventilation units

-   Control your* Itho Daalderop CVE with one simple add-on module
-   No hardware changes needed to the itho box, no warranty void
-   Control the speed setting of the fan from 0 - 254 through either a simple web-interface, MQTT or HTML API
-   Easily integrate this wifi controller in any home domotica system
-   Installation can be done in minutes
-   Detailed installation manual

Two versions of the firmware are available:
* A simple version with hardcoded SSID and password.
* A more advanced version that starts an access point when no SSID can be connected and allows you to setup the device specifics (Wifi and MQTT settings) and save them on SPIFFS using the webinterface.


###  CVE Models confirmed to work:
-   CVE ECO 2 (this unit is also sold by the brand 'Heatrae Sadia' in the uk) *
-   CVE ECO RFT SE/SP *
-   CVE-S eco fan RFT
-   CVE-S S CO2 (CO2 sensor not usable with this add-on)
-   HRU 200 ECO (also sold as 'Elektrodesign EHR 140 Akor BP' and 'Heatrae Sadia Advance Plus')
-   CVE-S Optima

###  NON-CVE Models confirmed to work:
-   HRU eco fan
-   HRU 350
-   DemandFlow
-	QualityFlow


###   An important note about the firmware:
The cve add-on is able to control the itho unit in standard or medium mode setting only. This means you can use the original remote but if you leave the itho box in low or high setting the itho won't accept commands from the add-on. This is itho designed behaviour. Adding a CC1101 RF module and/or letting the add-on present itself as virtual remote can circumvent this issue.
  
## I2C protocol

The Itho fan and add on modules both communicate as I2C master.

First the main pcb sends a start message:
```
Address (0x41),Write
Data: (0xC0),(0x00),(0x00),(0x00),(0xBE)
```
The add-on then replies (as slave):
```
Address (0x41),Write
Data: (0xEF),(0xC0),(0x00),(0x01),(0x06),(0x00),(0x00),(0x09),(0x00),(0x09),(0x00),(0xB6)
```
After which the main pcb confirms with another message:
```
Address (0x41),Write
Data: (0xC0),(0x00),(0x02),(0x05),(0x00),(0x00),(0x09),(0x60),(0x00),(0x4E)
```
After these initial init messages back and forth the add-on needs to switch to i2c master and sends 
speed commands to the main pcb like follows:
```
Address: (0x00),Write
Data: (0x60),(0xC0),(0x20),(0x01),(0x02),(b),(e),(h)
```

Where:  
   uint8_t b = target speed (0 - 254)  
   uint8_t e = 0  
   uint8_t h = 0 - (67 + b)  

It is possible to have other values for e (0, 64, 128, 192) for even more control steps, the complete formula for h will be:

   uint8_t h = (0-e) - (67+b)  
   

## Hardware:

A sample hardware design (KiCad) is included, this module can be plugged on the Itho main PCB directly without extra components.  
*Tested with Itho Daalderop CVE from late 2013 and 2019 (PCB no. 545-5103 and 05-00492)

~~PoC is done and working, PCBs have been ordered. I will update this page when the boards arrive and are proven to be working.~~  
PCB done and and tested to be working fine!  
I have a few assembled boards left for those who want to try this as well, you can find them on my Tindie store:

Change of components version 2.x:
Changed the wemos to the much faster ESP32 with more memory etc. Also easier to produce mechanically. Other change of components are to accomodate this change.
This version also added the option to solder a CC1101 RF module to be able to receive itho RF signals

Change of components version 1.2:
The Wemos boots too slow too often to receive the first I2C message from the Itho box. An Attiny 1614 was added to handle the init. After power-on the Attiny starts executing user code after about 65ms instead of +/-130ms of the Wemos. 130ms is about the point where the itho Box sends its first message.

Change of components version 1.1:
The ISO1540/ADUM 1250 ARZ solution did not work as expected. That's why for version 1.1 I switched to a quite common BSS138 MOSFET based logic level converter solution and replaced the other components with SMDs too. The SMD components are all 1206 in size so quite easy to solder by hand.

Choice of components version 1.0:

ESP8266 NodeMCU DevKit (https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit-v1.0) or WeMos D1 mini (https://docs.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1/d1_mini.html): 
readily available at low prices. Easy to integrate in projects.

ISO1540/ADUM 1250 ARZ: 
not the cheapest logic level convertor option but special designed for i2c and a one chip solution, SMD but still quite easy to solder by hand.

Recom R-78E5.0-1.0: 
the regulator (7805) on the itho mainboard is not suitable to drive extra loads like a esp8266/esp32. Luckily there is a pin on the mainboard that holds the output from the main
power supply (about 16,3 volts and definitely able to handle more than the 500mA of the on board regulator). Placing a 7805 (or similar) on the add-on board is possible 
but will probably generate lots of heat (up to 5 watts) because of big voltage drop.
That's why I selected the DC-DC converter from recom, very small package, high efficiency (90%).
